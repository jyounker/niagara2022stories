My name is Jonathan Younker, and I'm a librarian at [Brock University](https://www.brocku.ca/), located in St. Catharines, Ontario.  I received a research grant through the [VPR Canada Games Grants program](https://brocku.ca/canada-games/research-subcommittee/vpr-grants-program/) for this project.

### Goals

We’re collecting as much data as possible about the [Niagara 2022 Summer Games](https://niagara2022games.ca) with the hope that it proves useful to researchers in the future. With the help of Research Assistant Danielle Merasty, we aim to identify, collect, organize and disseminate quantitative and qualitative data about the Games — and by extension, life in Niagara — before, during and after the Games themselves.
