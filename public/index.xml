      <description>My name is Jonathan Younker, and I&amp;rsquo;m a librarian at Brock University, located in St. Catharines, Ontario. I received a research grant through the VPR Canada Games Grants program for this project.
Goals We’re collecting as much data as possible about the Niagara 2022 Summer Games with the hope that it proves useful to researchers in the future. With the help of Research Assistant Danielle Merasty, we aim to identify, collect, organize and disseminate quantitative and qualitative data about the Games — and by extension, life in Niagara — before, during and after the Games themselves.</description>

      <description>This site has been a work-in-progress for a while, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have it out the door and into the wild. It will serve as a main hub for Niagara 2022 Stories content, and a way of showcasing content aggregated via social media and through our digital exhibits platform, Omeka.
More content to come!</description>
